content_harvesting_task:
  description: >
    Collect recent news articles based on {topic}.

    Steps include:
    1. Use the search tool to search for recent news articles about {topic}
    2. From the search results, identify URLs from credible sources.

    3. **IMPORTANT: Only select actual article pages, not topic hubs or tag listings**
      You must filter out any URLs that are likely to be:
      - Topic/tag/section index pages (e.g., URLs containing "/tag/", "/topic/", "/hub/", "/section/", "/category/")
      - Pages with no unique headline or timestamp
      - Pages that only contain a list of other stories or links
      ✅ Acceptable article URLs:
      - Should contain a full article with body text
      - Should have a clear headline and publication date
      - Often include slugs like `/2023/10/.../story-title` or unique story IDs
      ❌ Reject the following types of URLs:
      - https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ 
      - https://apnews.com/hub
      - https://aljazeera.com/tag
      These are topic collections, not individual articles.

    4. For each **accepted** article URL:
      - Use the scrape tool to extract the full article content from the URL
      - Extract metadata: title, source, publication date and complete article text.

    5. Apply intelligent filtering to remove:
      - Articles shorter than 200 words
      - Articles older than 48 hours (unless specifically relevant)
      - Pages that failed to scrape or contain no substantial content

    6. Classify each article into appropriate topic categories (Tech, Politics, Business, Science, Health, Sports, International, etc.)

    7. Assign credibility scores (1-10) based on source reputation and content quality

    8. Assign relevance scores (1-10) based on how well the article matches the requested {topic}

       - Include the main development and immediate implications
       - Mention key players and basic context

       - Include multiple perspectives and expert opinions
       - Explain technical concepts for general audience
