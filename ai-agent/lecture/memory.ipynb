      "1. **Reliability**: This involves analyzing equipment performance data to predict failures and schedule maintenance proactively. Reliability engineering aims to minimize downtime by ensuring that machinery operates within its safe and efficient parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operation**: Operational data analysis focuses on monitoring daily activities, production rates, and compliance with safety and environmental regulations. It can also include analyzing process data to identify bottlenecks and improve throughput.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimization**: This entails using data to improve processes, reduce costs, and enhance product quality. Techniques can range from statistical analysis to machine learning, aiming to refine operational parameters for maximum efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Safety and Compliance**: Analyzing safety data (like incident reports and near-miss events) is crucial for improving safety protocols and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.\n",
