      "\n",

      "3. **Economic Stimulus**: During economic downturns, governments may issue bonds to raise funds for stimulus measures aimed at boosting demand and promoting economic growth.\n",

      "4. **Public Investment**: Bonds can be used to fund long-term investments that can help stimulate growth, such as in transportation, education, or healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Signals**: The issuance of bonds may also send signals to the market about the government's fiscal health and intentions, influencing investor confidence and economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Liquidity**: Bonds are often considered a safe and liquid investment, which makes them attractive to various investors, including individuals, institutions, and foreign governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Monetary Policy**: Governments may issue bonds as part of monetary policy strategies to control money supply and influence interest rates.\n",
